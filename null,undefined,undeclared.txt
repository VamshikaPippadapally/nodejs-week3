NULL vs UNDEFINED vs UNDECLARED:
---------------------------------

->program to understand the above concepts

example1:
try{
  undeclaredVar
}
catch(e) {
  if(e.name === 'ReferenceError') {
    console.log('var is undeclared')
  }
}

// check if undefined
var undefinedVar

if (typeof undefinedVar === 'undefined') {
   console.log('var is undefined')
}

// check if null
var nullVar = null

if (nullVar === null) {
   console.log('var is null')
}
note:
-----
->undefined variables are those that are not assigned any value but declared in the program. if we try to read the value, an error message "undefined" is displayed. 
->undeclared variables are those that are not declared in the program. But if undeclared variables are assigned some value then implicit declaration is done.
->null is a value of a variable and is a type of object.
->undeclared variables don’t even exist
->undefined variables exist, but don’t have anything assigned to them
->null variables exist and have null assigned to them
